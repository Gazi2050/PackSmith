# Getting Started
## Installation
To create a new package using `PackSmith`, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```bash

```
This will generate a fully structured project with all necessary tools pre-configured, so you can start coding right away.
### What to Expect in the CLI

ðŸ“‚ cd my-awesome-package
ðŸ“¦ npm install
```
## Folder Structure
After installation, your project will be structured like this:
```bash
my-awesome-package/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
â”œâ”€â”€ .npmignore            # Controls which files are published
â”œâ”€â”€ eslint.config.mjs     # ESLint configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/         # Installed dependencies (auto-generated)
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json     # npm lockfile
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Project metadata and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source code lives here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts          # Entry point of your package
â”œâ”€â”€ test/                 # Unit tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.test.ts     # Example test with Vitest
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ tsup.config.ts        # Build configuration (Tsup)
â””â”€â”€ vitest.config.ts      # Testing configuration
```
This structure is designed to be simple, readable, and ready for immediate development with everything in place to write, test, and bundle your package.
